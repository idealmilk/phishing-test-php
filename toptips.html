                <h3>Tips To Spot Phishing Emails<br></br></h3>
                <h4>1. Don’t trust the display name or the header</h4>
                <p>A favorite phishing tactic among cybercriminals is to spoof the display name of an email. They also spoof brands in the header from email address, including the domain name. Keep in mind that just because the sender’s email address looks legitimate (e.g james@scileads.com), it may not be. A familiar name in your inbox isn’t always who you think it is!<br></br></p>
                <h4>2. Look but don’t click</h4>
                <p>Cybercriminals love to embed malicious links in legitimate-sounding copy. Hover your mouse over any links you find embedded in the body of your email. If the link address looks weird, don’t click on it. If you have any reservations about the link, send the email directly to your security team.<br></br></p>
                <h4>3. Analyze the salutation</h4>
                <p>Is the email addressed to a vague “Valued Customer?” If so, watch out—legitimate businesses will often use a personal salutation with your first and last name.<br></br></p>
                <h4>4. Beware of urgent or threatening language in the subject line</h4>
                <p>Invoking a sense of urgency or fear is a common phishing tactic.<br></br></p>

                <h3>Importance of Having Two Factor Authentication<br></br></h3>
                <p>Passwords have been the mainstream form of authentication since the start of the digital revolution. But, this security measure is far from infallible. Here are some worrying facts about this traditional security measure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>90% of passwords can be cracked in less than six hours.</li>
                    <li>Two-thirds of people use the same password everywhere.</li>
                    <li>Sophisticated cyber attackers have the power to test billions of passwords every second.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Other Good Practices<br></br></h3>
                <h4>Ensuring Hard Drives Are Encrypted</h4>
                <p>Full disk encryption uses strong encryption algorithms to encrypt drives on your PCs, thereby protecting all data stored in the drives. With FDE, even though the drive is removed from the current computer and put into other devices, the drive data is still inaccessible if without a correct key.<br></br></p>
                <h4>Enable firewall protection at work and at home</h4>
                <p>Firewalls prevent unauthorized users from accessing your websites, mail services, and other sources of information that can be accessed from the web.</p>
